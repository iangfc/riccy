<!-- Copy No ___
hmmm... no we can't as yet... To do copies would imply that this were also an issuance, of the document not the contract.
And, there would be an additional contract for holding the document, as well as the expected contract to agree to the document.
Which would make for two Riccys, and as the text is similar, we'd meed something that clearly differentiated the holder's
obligations on one as opposed to the other.  So, like an invoicing cycle. And, as copies are numbered, this would make them like NFTs.
Interesting challenge, let's leave that for now.
