# Dos and Don'ts
Some tips on how to live happily in Ricardiana.

## Stars
+ Only use star bullets like * for parameters.
+ In your text, don't use star * bullets for other non-parameter things such as
   - bullet lists - use the - and + form instead, as with this document, and
   - emphasis - use the underscore form instead.

## Comments
+ Don't mix (HTML) comments with the start line of a multiline.
  - it's ok to have comments inside the multiline content.
+ Don't use more than one comment on one line.
+ Best not to mix comments and parameters at all.

## Contracts
+ Include all the elements of a contract;
  - an issuer and counterparties
  - some valuable claims, and some consideration for those claims
  - terms & conditions that specify rights, liabilities and obligations of the parties
+ even for contracts for test, artistry, games and teaching, create a real contract over a trivial topic
